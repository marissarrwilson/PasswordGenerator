# PasswordGenerator

This password generator will provide the user with a password suggestion based on the criteria chosen by the user via a series of prompts.

## Method
I made this password generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. I did not make changes to the HTML and CSS files, and added code to the JavaScript file.

* I started by making arrays of the variables that would be used to generate the password: upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. 
* I then made an array of confirmation prompts for the above mentioned arrays/variables.
* Afterwards, I created a loop if the user entered a value outside of the paramaters with if/else functions.
